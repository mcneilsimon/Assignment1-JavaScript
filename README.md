# Assignment1-JavaScript

The following assignmnet should use of launching certain events when the user clicks on the buttons at the top of the screen. 
What was also a requirement in this assignment was to make sure that the squares always stay within the window screen size. 
They never go beyond horizontally or vertically. This was implemented with the window.location.search.

It uses 5 different functions to implement the necesarry requirements in the assignment such as:
  - Keeping a counter for the box numbers
  - Checking whether the box needs to be blue or red
  - Removing all boxes and also resetting the counter
  - Adding a fade in effect for each box when the add blue, add red, remove blue, and remove red buttons are clicked.
